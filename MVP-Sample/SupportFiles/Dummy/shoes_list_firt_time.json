In front of 32,000 fans, he showed off his skills in a series of 1-on-1s, challenged one of his teammates to a game of H-O-R-S-E, and took part in a friendly exhibition game against some of Japan's famous sumo wrestlers. The latest Air Jordan XII celebrates the event with a print inspired by the kimonos the wrestlers wore during the game.",
